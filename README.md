<h2>Motivation:</h2>

The Path Of Exile Bulk Trade is heavily limited in the type of items you can bulk find. While GGG has added more and more support for bulk trade, there are still a lot of items that players want to trade on the native site that might be too taxing for GGG to support.

This tool is a workaround on this issue, allowing players to use the much better trade filters provided by the single trade option while adhering to GGG's rate limiting (it's their API), allowing you to aggregate searches as you load them and a shortcut to message along with the amount listed.

This allows you to aggregate all account names that match your desired filter, which beats even TFT's trade by a far margin in terms of bulk pricing and the fact that it is native to POE's trade site.

<h2> Installation:</h2>

You can get this tool by installing the [ViolentMonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) Extension, and then installing the [Path of Exile Trade Aggregator Extension](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/491939-path-of-exile-trade-aggregator-pathofexile-com-trade). I have not set up a Google Developer account yet so I could not have posted this as a Chrome extension. Sorry about that.

May your trades go well, and your bulk trades go even better!
